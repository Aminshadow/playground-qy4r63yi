# Fluent API

A fluent API is a sequence of chained function calls, often arranged in a way that reads like an English sentence, then thatâ€™s a fluent API:

```C#
someObject.ShouldNotifyFor(x => x.FirstName).And(x => x.FullName).When(x => x.FirstName = "Floyd"); 
```

Fluent API is a design pattern. The pattern was first described by Martin Fowler in his article on [Fluent Interface](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html), and the main idea is to make code which is readable to ordinary written prose. 

The code build on the design [Builder design pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder). And as the reader notice in the code example above make the code an extensive use of lambda expressions, which is quite normal for Fluent API .

## Existing fluent APIs

There is a lot of existing fluent APIs for C#, some of them are:

- [LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/)
- [Azure Management Libraries for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-libraries-for-net)
- [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/), used for accessing REST APIs
- [Fluent Assertions](https://fluentassertions.com/) (used for unit testing)

## Your own fluent API

As applications becomes more complex, can the development of a custom fluent API be a good investment as fluent APIs are creating a domain-specific language. Which makes is possible to describe complex business logic in few lines of fluent API (if of course it's implemented in the API).

As with all other APIs designing fluent APIs is not an easy task, as you will need to find a balance locking in the developer using the API or giving to free access. The problem is that it's almost impossible to foresee how the users of your API is planning to use the API.

When designing you fluent API can it be a good trick to try to tell all the "stories" that you can think the users are going to implement with the API. This can be done be creating a tree of actions which you are imaging the user to perform, and in that why document the path you expect or limit the user to follow.

A path consist of fluent methods, and these could be categorized into either starting, context or exit methods:

- Starting methods: Initializes the execution of a path
  - eg: StartX(), QueryX(), UpdateX(), SelectX()
- Context methods: Specify the information within a path
  - eg: WithX(), WithoutX(), UsingX(), AddX(), RemoveX()
- Exit methods: Ends execution of a path
  - eg: ApplyX(), AttachX(), ToX(), And(), Or()

## Example of custom fluent API

```C# runnable
class Program{
    static void Main()
    {
        new Mammal("Human")
            .WithBrain()
            .WithLegs(2)
            .WithArms(2)
        .BringToLife();
    }
}


class Mammal : IMammal
{
	private IEnumerable<BodyPart> BodyParts {get; set;}
	private string Name {get; set;}

	public Mammal(string name)
	{
		// Start method
		BodyParts = new List<BodyPart>();
		Name = name;
	}

	public IMammal WithArms(int number)
	{
		// context method
		((List<BodyPart>)BodyParts).Add(new BodyPart() { Name = "Arms", Amount = 2 });
		return this;
	}

	public IMammal WithBrain()
	{
		// context method
		((List<BodyPart>)BodyParts).Add(new BodyPart() { Name = "Brain", Amount = 1});
		return this;
	}

	public IMammal WithLegs(int number)
	{
		// context method
		((List<BodyPart>)BodyParts).Add(new BodyPart() { Name = "Legs", Amount = 2 });
		return this;
	}
	
	public void BringToLife() 
	{
		// Exit method
		foreach (var bp in BodyParts)
		{
			Console.WriteLine($"{Name} has {bp.Amount} {bp.Name}");
		}	
	}
}

interface IMammal
{
	IMammal WithBrain();
	IMammal WithLegs(int number);
	IMammal WithArms(int number);
	void BringToLife();
}

class BodyPart
{
	public int Amount {get; set;}
	public string Name {get; set;}
}


```
