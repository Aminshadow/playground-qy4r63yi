C# is a [multi paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages) programming language, which is used in the Microsoft .NET framework, currently (March 2020) in [version 8.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/da-dk/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/nullable-reference-types).
